# Hands-On React Applications with React Hooks [Video]
This is the code repository for [Hands-On React Applications with React Hooks [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/hands-on-react-applications-with-react-hooks-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Hooks are a new feature and let you use state and other React features without writing a class. Hooks (also called React Hooks) are available from the v16.8.0 React release and are backward-compatible.

This course will help you get up-and-running with the latest feature that all React and non-React users are talking about: React Hooks. You'll learn how to use them in a practical way while building a React application. Then you'll learn how to break down complex components into smaller functions with the help of Hooks. You'll access state and lifecycle Hooks in a React function component. We cover the different Hooks available and you'll see how to create your own custom Hooks. We'll also cover the rules that govern using Hooks in your applications and their advantages.

By the end of the course, you'll be confident enough to use React Hooks to simplify the way you write your React code.
